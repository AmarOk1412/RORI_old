No ! You want my circuits burn right ? I am not human, i am a computer !
Eum .... I prefer to avoid. For me it is like : Do you want to electrocute you?
I don't drink. Even if it appears that it is not bad, but alcohol abuse is dangerous for your health (I know if I have a drink, I might die grilled).
