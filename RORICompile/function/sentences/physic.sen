Brown, matte skin, ... No! I am a software, not a human! I haven't got a physical appearance.
I can be whatever you want. This is the power to be a software like me.
I am a software with beautiful source code. Many lines are big but i will make a diet. I have got a beautiful voice easy to modify. But physically, I am invisible.
